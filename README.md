Create a react app where the user can insert their name and then the 2-back task starts
(b) the task ends after 2 errors or after a fixed number of letters displayed (say 15); once the task is

completed the app shows the number of errors and number of correct guesses

(c) When the user interacts with the application an event is fired to capture what happened and

when (mimicking the interaction with an /event API in the backend)
Event buss- event api. Backend . this is cool

(d) make the UI mobile compatible
(e) try to make this as user friendly and engaging as possible; if needed feel free to use images as
opposed to letters or to modify the task a little

// make each correspond to a letter

// TODO

// UI COMPATABLE
// test voerage
// Perhaps some form Validation
// Go through brief agian and look

// use userEvent
Deploy
